This project was crated using springboot,Angular and with many restful dependencies.

In this project I had prepared frontend with angular framework with the help of springboot I had made backend to store the data,basically springboot is a automation tool
helps for rapid application development and mysql is used as databse .So finally it's a three tier web application.

Run npm install in the plasmaDonorApp directrory to install dependencies of the Angular app
Run ng serve -o for server to start at local. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
